# RISC-PIC Processor Design Project

## Project Overview
This academic project, conducted during the second year of engineering studies at Télécom Paris, focuses on understanding RISC architecture and designing a 3-stage pipelined processor. Inspired by the PIC16F84A microcontroller, the **RISPIC** processor serves as a practical exploration of pipeline optimization, instruction set design, and hardware implementation. The project was developed collaboratively in a team setting.

## Team Members
- **Hichem Chtourou**

- **AGOUZAL Said**  

## Key Contributions
### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Design
- Designed and documented the custom **RISPIC instruction set**, ensuring alignment with the processor’s pipelined architecture and functional requirements.
- Optimized instructions for efficiency in decoding and execution, balancing simplicity with computational capability.

### Pipeline Design & Optimization
- Developed a **3-stage pipeline diagram** (Fetch, Decode, Execute) to streamline instruction processing and mitigate hazards.
- Analyzed pipeline performance, identifying critical paths and proposing solutions for structural and data hazards.

### Processor Schematic Design
- Created the **high-level schematic** of the RISPIC processor using digital design tools, integrating core components such as the ALU, registers, and control unit.
- Validated the architecture through functional simulations and iterative testing.
